# Some personal notes for using GCP

I need to actually write up more of what I've learned.
For now, I'll simply write documentation progressively as topics arise.

the script `vm.sh` is copied here for posterity but the most recent version is in `github.com/mjfos2r/scripts/vm.sh`
or wherever I've moved it. I can't predict whatever organizational structure I'll decide to use in the future but I know that I will be optimizing things.
